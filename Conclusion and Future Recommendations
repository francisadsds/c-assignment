Importance of OOP in Software Development:
OOP provides a structured approach to software development, making it easier to manage complexity, reuse code, and maintain systems. It promotes modularity, scalability, and flexibility, which are essential for large-scale applications like the student management system.

Future Recommendations:

Use abstract classes to define a common interface for all student types.

Implement exception handling to manage errors like invalid input or missing data.

Use templates to create generic data structures for managing student records.

Introduce design patterns like Singleton for the StudentManagementSystem class to ensure a single instance.

Add file handling to store and retrieve student records persistently.
